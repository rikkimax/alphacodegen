# alphacodegen

Code generation with an Î± difference.

## Building
If you do not require x86 target compiled in then ``alphacodegen:common`` subpackage is all you need.
Otherwise you will need to run ``alphacodegen:pregen1`` and ``alphacodegen:pregen2`` to generate the required tables. Once that is done you may use ``alphacodegen:generated``. The generated subpackage is comitted into the repository for dub users. Only rerun it if things have changed since it was comitted.
